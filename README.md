WPezDeveloper - Facebook Group: Getting Started 0.0.1
=====================================================

=> FYI - This is an unproofed work in progress. Please excuse the lack of markdown, etc. at the moment. Thx. 


=> THIS GROUP IS FOR YOU IF:

- You build things that typically render in a browser; 
- and most often WordPress is the foundation of that creation (i.e., application or website); 
- that said, you understand and appreciate there are many topics, skills and roadblocks - not always directly WordPress related - along that creation journey;
- and you're humble and you want to share with, offer help to and/or ask question of others on similar journeys.


=> MISSION STATEMENT: TODO



=> GUIDELINES FOR POSTING IN THIS GROUP:

1) Please preface your post with relevant #hashtags. 

a) This helps to give people quick context. That is, should they keep reading or not. Quick context will be especially important as the group scales and volume increases. 

b) Facebook's Group search at times feels questionable. Ideally #hashtags should help make something easier to find later. Let's all trying to think ahead.

2) If you feel you must, #OffTopic is okay from time to time. 

Please try to limit it to one per week. For example, "I've been coding to the new album from _____. Love it. If you're into ____ then I recommend it." 

3) #ShamelessSelfPromotion (or #SSP) is okay from time to time. 

Please try to limit it to one per week. 

a) Good: "Just launched a site. Check it out. Let's me know what you think." Is okay.

b) Not Good: "We build websites. Blah. Blah. Blah..." Selling services to people who are not your target market is spam. Spam is not welcome here.
