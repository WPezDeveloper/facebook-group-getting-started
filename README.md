Facebook Group: WPezDeveloper
=============================

Getting Started: 0.0.2
======================

=> FYI - This is an unproofed work in progress. Please excuse the lack of markdown, etc. at the moment. Thx. 


=> This group is for you is...
------------------------------

- You build things that typically render in a browser; 
- and most often WordPress is the foundation of that creation (i.e., application or website); 
- that said, you understand and appreciate there are many topics, skills and roadblocks - not always directly WordPress related - along that creation journey;
- and you're humble and you want to share with, offer help to and/or ask question of others on similar journeys.


=> Mission Statement: TODO
--------------------------



=> Guidelines for posting in this group
---------------------------------------

1. Please preface your post with relevant #hashtags. 

- This helps to give people quick context. That is, should they keep reading or not. Quick context will be especially important as the group scales and volume increases. 

- Facebook's Group search at times feels questionable. Ideally #hashtags should help make something easier to find later. Let's all trying to think to the horizon.

2. If you feel you must, #OffTopic is okay from time to time. 

- Please try to limit it to one per week. 

- Example: "I've been coding to the new album from ________. Love it. If you're into ____ then I recommend it." 

3. #ShamelessSelfPromotion (or #SSP) is okay from time to time. 

- Please try to limit it to one per week. 

- Good: "We just launched a site. Check it out. Let me know what you think." Is okay.

- Good: "I just shipped a new version of my plugin that does ________. Here's the link..."

- Not Good: "We build websites. Blah. Blah. SEO. Blah..." Selling services to people who are not your target market is spam. Spam is not welcome here.

4. Basic questions - #Noob or #WP101  - are also okay. 

- Before you ask here please ask The Google and/or The Bing.

- Please try to limit such questions to one per week.

- If you don't get a timely answer then just presume no one was interested / able to help. Don't bother to whine. There are also other WordPress groups on FB.
